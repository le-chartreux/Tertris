## HOW TO USE IT ?
1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/VMoM/Tertris/releases)
2. Chose a release (prefer the latest)
3. Follow the guide of the release you chose


## LANGUAGE:
- Everything is in english üá¨üáß (except maybe some `TODO` in the code that are in french)


## DISCLAIMERS
- Tertris uses the [curses library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) for Python 3 to print it interface, so **it can only run in Unix-based OS** üêßüçé
- Tertris is still in progress, so a lot of features (such as level counting) may not being implemented, but it is playable üéÆ
